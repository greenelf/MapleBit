Ignore this folder if it seems to constantly appear empty.
Cause that's what we want :D

For now this will be used for putting mail downloads
cache until the user has successfully downloaded their
desired/selected mail.

So it will be a constant process of:
Create -> Add Text -> Download -> Delete.

Overtime we will think of a proper use of this ;)
