MapleBit
============
Welcome to the MapleBit Github page. MapleBit is a Content Management System (CMS) built for Maplestory servers. The CMS is currently in Beta testing, and is considered to be both stable and secure. 

Installation
============
To install the CMS, you need to upload the entire .zip to your web server. Then, extract the .zip, and open your browser. Navigate to the location in which you extracted the .zip. You'll be presented with a web based installer. Next, enter in your database connection details, and configure your website. Once you've done this, the installer will lock itself and redirect you to your website.

Features
============
Some features of MapleBit include:

 - **Automatic and Flexible Installer.** All you have to do is have your database connection information handy, and put them in the web based installer. You can also use a custom database prefix to have multiple installations of MapleBit in one database.
 - **Customizable.** You can change the site's theme, using BootSwatch themes. Then, you can add your own banner and background. This allows you to use the base MapleBitCMS, but still maintain and display the uniqueness of your server and website.
 - **User Profiles.** Your users can have a richer interaction with your website once they signup for a display name, which will allow them to comment on news, events, gmblogs, and have profile pages.
 - **Modern.** MapleBit uses modern web technology such as HTML5, CSS3, and MySQLi. MapleBit is also responsive, so all devices can use the website.
 - **Beautiful.** Rankings MapleBit mimics the old Cype's rankings system. Updated with a newer version of GD, the rankings are just as amazing as they were when the original Cype was released.
 - **Comments.** MapleBit features a commenting system which allows users to post comments with Gravatars and rich formatting.
